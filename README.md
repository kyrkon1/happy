## World Happiness Report From 2020 to 2021
Goal: Analyze the possible factors that changed during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Figure out which countries are the happiest and which are the least happiest.
What factors are associated with COVID-19?

Our prediction: 
During COVID-19 (2020), the World Happiness Scores would be less than 2021's World Happiness Scores

For our project, we focused on the two datasets from the Kaggle website:
